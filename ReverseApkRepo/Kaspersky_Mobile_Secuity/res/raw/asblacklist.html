<p class="bodytext">The list of blocked contacts contains contacts from which you do not want to receive incoming messages. For each contact, you can select the type of events to block (only SMS messages, only calls, or SMS messages and calls). For SMS messages, you can additionally enter a key phrase used to identify messages as spam and block them if a match is found. </p>
<p class="bodytext">The application blocks only those calls and SMS messages that satisfy all the criteria of one of the entries in the list of blocked contacts. Calls and SMS messages are allowed if they do not satisfy one or more criteria of the entry in the list of blocked contacts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For example, the contact number &quot;+123456789&quot; has been added to the list of blocked contacts. The following filter criteria are selected for the contact: block only SMS messages with the key word &quot;advert&quot;. The filter mode is set to <span class="buttonscharacter">Blocked contacts</span>, which causes the application to block calls and SMS messages from blocked contacts only and allow incoming calls and SMS messages from other contacts. </p>
<p class="bodytext">According to the selected filter criteria, the application blocks SMS messages from the contact that contain the word &quot;advert&quot;, but allows calls and SMS messages from the contact without this key word.</p>
<p class="warningbody">The same contact with identical filter criteria cannot be included in both the blocked and allowed contacts lists. If a contact with matching filter criteria is already saved in one of the lists, the application notifies you of this fact when you try to add the contact.</p>
<p class="bodytext">To add a contact, tap <span class="buttonscharacter">Add</span>. You can add a contact number to the list in one of the following ways: specify the number manually by selecting a call in the list of calls or an SMS message in the list of incoming SMS messages. </p>
<p class="bodytext">You can change or delete a contact from the context menu.</p>
