<p class="bodytext">Anti-Virus protects your device from viruses and other malware. Anti-Virus includes the following components: protection, scan and update. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Protection is enabled when the operating system starts up, and is always found in the device's memory. Protection prevents the device in real time from being infected: it scans all files that are opened, saved and executed, and all new applications.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Scan is launched on demand to detect and eliminate threats on your device (such as infected files as they are opened, unopened files, and uninstalled files in archives). Kaspersky Mobile Security allows you to perform a full or partial scan of the device's content. You can choose to scan the device's whole file system, the content of the internal memory, or a specific folder.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Updates to Kaspersky Mobile Security's anti-virus databases and application version (henceforth &quot;updates&quot;) ensure that your device protection is up to date. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Kaspersky Mobile Security uses anti-virus databases when scanning for malware. The anti-virus databases of the application contain descriptions of all currently known malware and ways to neutralize them, as well as descriptions of other undesirable malicious objects. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to update the anti-virus databases regularly. If more than 15 days have passed since the last update, the databases are regarded as out of date. Protection will then be less reliable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As well as the anti-virus databases, Kaspersky Mobile Security allows you to update the application version. Application version updates remove vulnerabilities from Kaspersky Mobile Security, add new functions, or improve existing functions. </p>
<p class="warningbody">Regular updates require an active license to use the application. If the license has expired, updates are not available. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Kaspersky Mobile Security runs updates from Kaspersky Lab's update servers (special websites that contain updates for all Kaspersky Lab products).</p>
<p class="settingdescr"><a id="h60267" class="expandingblocktemplate" title="Anti-Virus:additional_(avother)_Protection" href="javascript:toggleBlock('60267')" target="_self">Protection mode</a></p>
<div id="d60267" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext">Protection is enabled when the operating system starts up, and is always found in the device's memory. Protection allows scanning of all files that are opened, saved and launched, and all applications that are installed.</p>
<p class="settingname">Protection mode</p>
<p class="bodytext">The mode used by Protection to track changes in the file system in background mode and to scan it for malicious objects. The following modes are available:</p>
<ul class="listbullet1"><li class="listbullet1"><span class="buttonscharacter">Extended</span>. Protection scans for the presence of malicious objects when any action is performed on them (for example, when they are opened, run, copied, saved, moved, or modified). Protection scans new applications as soon as they are installed.</li><li class="listbullet1"><span class="buttonscharacter">Recommended</span>. Protection scans for the presence of malicious objects only in newly installed programs and does not scan other files or actions involving them. Protection scans new programs as soon as they are installed.</li><li class="listbullet1"><span class="buttonscharacter">Disabled</span>. Protection is disabled.<p class="listcontinue1">You can temporarily disable Protection to reduce load on the device when running several tasks concurrently. </p>
<p class="warningcontinue1">The Kaspersky Lab specialists do not recommend disabling Protection, as this could lead to the infection of your computer and loss of data.</p>
<p class="listcontinue1">If Protection is disabled, it does not affect other Anti-Virus tasks, such as the scanning of the file system for viruses or anti-virus database updates.</p>
</li></ul></div><p class="settingdescr"><a id="h61063" class="expandingblocktemplate" title="" href="javascript:toggleBlock('61063')" target="_self">Cloud Security Scan</a></p>
<div id="d61063" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext">There is an additional scan of newly installed programs using the Kaspersky Security Network cloud service (a special Kaspersky Lab online service that contains information about the reliability of files, applications, and Internet resources). Scanning using the cloud service helps to protect your data from new and unknown threats.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If the box is checked,&nbsp;Kaspersky Mobile Security carries out additional checks on newly installed programs before they are run for the first time using the Kaspersky Security Network cloud service. If the box is unchecked, Kaspersky Mobile Security does not carry out additional checks.</p>
