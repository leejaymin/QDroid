  <h2> Mosaic Quality </h2>
  <strong>Mosaic Size Configuration </strong> <br />
  <p> The setting "Mosaic Size" controls the number of thumbnails used in the generation of the mosaic.
    A large number of thumbnails results in better resolution of the final mosaic. </p>
  <strong>Number of Images</strong> <br />
  <p> The greater the number of pictures, the greater the possibility that the application will find a good match for replacement. </p>
  <strong>Colors Diversity</strong>
  <p> Following the same principle of the Number of Images, a higher color diversity increases the chances of findind a good match for replacement. </p>
  <h2> Troubleshooting </h2>
  <strong>Performance</strong> <br />
  <p> The larger the number of images, the more time the application will need to scan the images and, subsequently, generate the mosaic. The decrease in quality Mosaic configuration, or number of images used, can improve performance in the generation, therefore decreasing the quality of the final mosaic. </p>
  <strong>Resolution of the mosaic in Android Gallery</strong> <br />
  <p> We found out that, in some devices, the android gallery can scale down the pictures before displaying them. Making the details of the thumbnails not visible. However, the details remain in the mosaic, to view them, an alternative is to open the mosaic directly in the Mosaicture app, using a computer, or use another image viewer. </p>
  <strong>Last Photos are not showing up</strong> <br />
  <p> Corrupted images may cause the panel Last Photos to not load properly. Check if there are any corrupted images, delete them if so, and restart the application. </p>
