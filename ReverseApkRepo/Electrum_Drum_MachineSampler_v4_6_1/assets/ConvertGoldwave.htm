<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="3">Converting samples to work with Electrum
Drum using Goldwave</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If we use Goldwave software, we can convert
massive amounts of samples all at once using it's batch processing feature. The
following is a small tutorial on how to do that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other nice thing about Goldwave is you can
perform this batch processing using the unregistered version, it works just
fine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, here we can see I have a folder with
lots of subfolders with various samples in them. These samples are actually from
July 2009 Computer Music magazine DVD.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Conver3.jpg" width="478" height="423"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So we start Goldwave and go to <b>File-&gt;Batch
Processing. </b>You will then get this dialog:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Conver2.jpg" width="468" height="481"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Click the <b>Add Folder button</b> and add the
root folder that contains all the samples you want to convert. I added the root
of where all my samples were. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Click &quot;Add Folder&quot; and I selected my
root folder, and also told it to include all subfolders.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Conver7.jpg" width="382" height="115"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the &quot;Convert&quot; tab, change the
settings to match what the settings show below</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Conver4.jpg" width="468" height="481"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now we also want to make sure that the samples
are loud enough and that they don't have too much blank (empty) sound at their
beginning or end. So select the &quot;Process&quot; tab, and then add the
following two effects:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Conver5.jpg" width="468" height="481"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now finally click the &quot;Folder&quot; tab
and select the output directory. You can also preserve the input folder
structure if you want.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Conver6.jpg" width="468" height="481"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that's it! Now you can press
&quot;Begin&quot; and it will convert all the files it finds, any format. The
nice thing about this also is Goldwave handles any errors automatically for you.
It will also convert MP3, AIFF, or whatever it finds, to the format that
Electrum Drum wants.</font></p>
