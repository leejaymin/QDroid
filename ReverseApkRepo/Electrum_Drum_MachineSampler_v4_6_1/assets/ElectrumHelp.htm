<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>Please read this file for
latest changes and features, as well as FAQ!</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>PLEASE NOTE! Since the switch
to 16 bit it is easier to make a sound loud enough to clip and sound
distorted. If low bass kick drums sound very distorted it is because
they are too loud, just turn the volume down on the kick drum sample.
I currently am working on a limiter to take care of this more
cleanly! Thanks!</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>Latest Changes:</B></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.5.5. - Fixed error in WAV

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.4.9.4 - Removed high
priority setting in the audio thread, some devices were having issues
and actually causing audio gapping with it ON. Setting it OFF BY
DEFAULT. Can turn on in the BPM settings dialog.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.4.9 - Fixed play start
error, bug has always been there but now only really apparent since
the stereo switch. Would mistakenly start the very first loop a bit
too late.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.4.8 - Allow full UI
rotation on XLARGE screens (tablets). Fixed soft keyboard focus on
BPM and Sample edit screens to not come up until you touch a text
entry field. Adjusted the running lights feature to be more accurate.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.4.7 - Fixed import from
exported folder, was not importing the 22050khz stereo files
properly. Fixed crash in Delay or Distortion settings if you ran out
of memory.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.4.5 - Added stereo output
(Electrum now outputs 22050khz stereo 16bit) and pan controls</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.4.3 - Fixed out of memory
error on multitouch pads dialog</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.4.0 - Added reset buttons

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.3.0 - Fixed multitouch pads
to fit all screens correctly, including tablet screens. Added auto
loop ability to multitouch pads. Changed their graphics too to look a
bit better.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.2.2 - fixed some bugs in
the WAVE loader code, should be compatible now with almost all WAV
files (uncompressed of course). Was having problems with WAV's from
ProTools because of extra data. I wasn't searching for the chunks
properly. Recoded to search for WAV chunks now instead of hardcoded
offsets. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Added code to bring up the Electrum menu if you press on the &quot;BPM&quot;
and &quot;Resolution&quot; text display area, to make it easier for
devices that may not have hardware menu buttons.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.2.1 - Added delete button
in the &quot;SAVE&quot; dialogs, fixed some save bugs that were in
those dialogs. Can't delete directories just yet, but you can delete
files.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.2.0 - Added patch text to
main screen, and drum names now show up in the mixer. Exporting now
appends the BPM value to the filename.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.1.1 - Fixed sound slot so
&quot;FitBPM&quot; is sticky, so preview while playing will fit BPM
when possible.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>4.1.0 - All new graphics,
fixed mixer to work better, fixed some more bugs, etc!</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.9.9.1 - Fixed small bug
that would cause the sequencer to crash when you touched an invalid
area in the sequence list window.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.9.9 - Added Quick switch
buttons to the sound slot editor dialog, so you don't have to leave
the dialog to set pad sounds - you can move through all sounds now
using the buttons.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.9.8 - Layout work to
support Galaxy tablet, and fixed file browser to remember where you
were last time you opened it.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.9.5 - Layout work to
support small screens and large screens (tablets)</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.9.1 - Added support for
1/12 resolution, which is 1/8T, for triplet programmed beats. Set
your pattern length to 12 for a full measure in that resolution.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.9.0 - Added two more sound
pads. Some more bugfixes. Can now install to sdcard on Froyo as well.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.8.0 - Added mixer and
changed global volume knob to a mixer button.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.7.0 - Can now save and load
drumkits seperately from patches, so you can load in different kits
and still use the current pattern you are working on.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.6.2 - Flipped position of -
and + buttons on BPM dialog, added File overwrite warnings to saving
operations.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.6.1 - bugfix for to hide
any media files that are directly in the samples folder and not in
subfolders under that.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.6.0 - Added support for
loading normal 44100Khz, Stereo or Mono, 16bit WAV files. Also can
load 44100Khz, Stereo, 24bit files, but it appears that android
doesn't like that format and it corrupts the files. Electrum now
converts the files internally to 22050Khz Mono 16bit for playing
them. This should now make it easier to just grab some samples and
dump then on the sdcard for electrum to use (but if they are 24bit
you'll probably still have to convert them since like I said android
doesn't like them apparently - even its media player can't play
them), so if you load some samples and all you get is static, they
are probably in 24bit format</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.5.1 - bugfix for the BPM
buttons in other language systems, to handle decimal point
conversion.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.5.0 - Added shuffle feature
so you can now program swing beats and hiphop style beats and get
some funky rythmns going. NOTE!!!! I don't have it coded into the
MIDI export yet, I will try and get that done! Also I think I finally
squashed that playback lag bug for good this time. Now should play
almost right away when you press play. Oh and guess what? Global
volume is now also finally saved with your patch!! Took me a while to
get that one in eh? Also I removed the internal volume limits check,
going to rely on the hardware. This means patterns will play louder
than before and may clip. For this reason I coded it so if it loads
in an old pattern, it sets the volume around 65% to prevent loudness
clipping. If you adjust it afterward and save the new volume will be
saved with the patch from now on.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.3.0 - Added a multitouch
pad dialog that you can use to play the loaded sounds using
multitouch. Be aware though that this requires android 2.0, and on
some devices you are limited to how many fingers. The DROID for
example can only use 2 points at once (the screen driver only allows
that, it's a hardware issue)</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.2.1 - Added feature to
allow playing the pads polyphony (so they don't cut each other's
sound off). NO multitouch right now though. Considering also adding
option to set a pad to loop auto when hit, but still in the works.
Studying more MPC docs.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.2.0 - Added Recording
feature - you can now record up to a 5 second sample into a sound
slot. Recordings will get saved with patterns as well when saving. </B></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.1.9 - Changed so drum
machine will continue playing even if losing app focus or the screen
turns off. Needs PHONE_STATE permission now so we can stop playing if
someone calls. Also change to &quot;singleTask&quot; state so you can
always return by using the home button, or using the launcher icon
again - will return to the same current running instance of the drum
machine.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.1.8 - OOPS, lost progress
bar when I got rid of the title bar. Brought one back for exporting
purposes (so you know how long it's taking!). Added BPM up down
buttons, they also are Auto-Repeat too. Fixed a bug where if a sound
couldn't be loaded anymore from sdcard it would cause NULL errors
when playing.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.1.5 - Changed GUI around to
make some things easier to use.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.1.0 - MIDI export and PAD
sound export features.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.0.1 - ability to turn
off/on the sequence running lights</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>3.0.0 - Lots of stuff. WAV
editor, etc. some bug fixes. Sequence running lights.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.7.0 - Sequencer! And some
bug fixes here and there.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.6.0 - Loop fit BPM feature
to auto fit loops to match the current BPM. Adjusts the pitch of the
loop until it matches the current BPM</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.5.5 - Added live play
pattern sequencer. Allows you to play patterns in the order you want
live by pressing the pattern buttons as the machine plays. Recordable
sequencer to come soon. Some bug fixes.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.5.0 - Some bug fixes. Added
pattern length adjustment. Changed WAV export code to get ready for
sequencer (for long songs). Can now program up to 32 patterns.
Sequencer is in progress!</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.4.0 - Added sample pitch
change feature, can alter pitch by semitone now. See &quot;Setting
sample pitch&quot;</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><FONT SIZE=1>2.3.1 - allow sample preview
when not playing as well (like it used to do).</FONT> </B></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.3.0 - Now uses 16 bit
samples internally and can load 8 or 16 bit external samples! Also
sample loading is a LIVE preview in the drumbeat. Also added error
checking to sample loader. REMOVED 606 DRUM. It has been changed to
an 808 drum now. Fixed some bugs in the audio generation code that
were creating clicking and popping noises, now also should run faster
too!</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.2.1 - added higher priority
to audio generating thread code to prevent gapping</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.2.0 - added ability to
toggle a sound slot's mute by double tapping it</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.1.2 - changed accent (blue
notes) to be activated with a long press</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=1><B>2.1.1 - added global volume

<P><A NAME="INTRO"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Introduction</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Electrum Drum is a drum pattern creator using
8 sounds (similar to a TR-909) and 16 slots per sound. You may
program up to 32 total patterns.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Electrum Drum works by calculating the timing
required and then mixing the sound data together internally and
playing the audio data as a stream fed directly to the phone's
speaker.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Electrum includes 6 drumkits internally. The
basic drumkits included with the program are:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">808<BR>Rock<BR>909<BR>Orchestral<BR>HipHop<BR>Human
Beatbox</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The programming slots are ordered in this
manner: </FONT>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr55.jpg" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=485 HEIGHT=120 BORDER=0></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The first row of 8 will play, and then the
second row will play.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To select a sound slot, simply touch that
sound&rsquo;s button to select it and then the pattern buttons will
apply to that sound. If the machine is not currently running, then
the pad (the sound button) will also play the sound that is assigned
to it. This enables you to remember what sound it is.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">In the case of long sounds that are assigned
to a pad, you can press the &quot;Stop&quot; button to force the
sound to stop playing.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr56.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=479 HEIGHT=91 BORDER=0></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To set a sound to play on a specific beat in
the pattern, simply touch the pattern button to turn it on. It will
display as <B>orange</B> when on.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr57.jpg" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=482 HEIGHT=120 BORDER=0></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you <B>Long Press</B> the pattern button,
it will turn <B>yellow</B>.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr58.jpg" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=482 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Blue means that the sound will now play a bit
louder in that slot, to add some &ldquo;Accent&rdquo; to the sound.
This allows you some sound variety.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you then touch the button a third time, it
will now again be OFF.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To play the pattern, simply touch the &ldquo;Play
current pattern&rdquo; button. <B>The &quot;Play current pattern&quot;
button is the button with only one Play symbol on it.</B> The sound
will be generated and then played. You may push the STOP button at
any time to cancel sound generation and / or playing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can edit patterns while the sound is
still playing to find the right beat that you are looking for.</FONT></P>

first touch its volume slider (anywhere along the length of the

<P><A HREF="#TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana">Back to top</FONT></A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="EXAMPLE"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Programming Example</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Let&rsquo;s make a basic 4 on the floor beat.
The default BPM is 120 and the default resolution is 1/16. This means
that we will divide a measure into 16 pieces. So in this case every
four slots will be a beat, for a four on the floor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Select the first drum sound, usually a Kick</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr62.jpg" NAME="graphics9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=489 HEIGHT=329 BORDER=0></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now simply turn every fourth pattern button
ON by touching it.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr63.jpg" NAME="graphics10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=489 HEIGHT=326 BORDER=0></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now you can push the &ldquo;Play&rdquo;
button to play the current pattern. <B>The &quot;Play current&quot;
button is the button with only one play symbol on it.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you set the resolution to 1/32, then for a
four on the floor beat, you would need an ON button every 8 slot,
because a whole measure would now be 32 slots long. That means to do
a full four on the floor beat, you would need to use 2 patterns in a
row. You can program two patterns and then use the &ldquo;Play all&rdquo;
button to play all patterns in sequence. The advantage of 1/32
resolution is you now can make very fast drum patterns; for example,
a fast snare roll.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To add another pattern, simply touch the &ldquo;Pat
Up&rdquo; button. You will now have an empty set of patterns for each
sound where you can input the next pattern. The &quot;Play&quot;
button plays only the currently selected pattern.</FONT></P>
<P><A HREF="#TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana">Back to top</FONT></A></P>
<P><A NAME="SHUFFLE"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Beat Shuffle (Swung
note)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Add some funk to your beats with Shuffle!
Shuffle is a feature on a drum machine that gives a swing feeling to
the beat. It works by putting a delay in the 8th notes that are
between the 16th notes. In Electrum this delay is variable so you can
adjust it to your liking. The knob for shuffle is found on the BPM
settings dialog:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr66.jpg" NAME="graphics11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=469 HEIGHT=307 BORDER=0></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The Shuffle knob works just like any other
knob, press down to select it, and then move up to raise the amount
(rotate clockwise) or down to lower the amount (counter-clockwise).
When at 0%, no shuffle is applied.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Also be aware that since shuffle is a delay
on 8th notes that are between 16th's, shuffle will not take place if
you are running in 1/8 note resolution, since there are no 16th
notes! It only works in 1/16 and 1/32 resolutions.</FONT></P>

time fits three 1/8 notes into the same amount of time a 1/4 note
would usually take. This gives a &quot;swing&quot; feel to the beat,

sample by itself with the modifications so you can hear it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To exit the dialog simply press your phone's
back button. The sample settings will remain. Another nice feature is
that if you later wish to change the pitch of the sample, doing so
will not harm your sample selection. Electrum will recalculate the
proper start/end points to match the new pitch change!</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="BPM"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Loop fit BPM Setting</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Loop Fit is a feature that shrinks/stretches
the sound sample to fit the current BPM. This allows you to load a
loop and fit it to your current project.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Note: Loop Fit resamples the sound to fit
the BPM. The pitch WILL change! It does not retain pitch at this
time. (However, I've found that it's nice to have it change pitch, it
gives you more variety)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>In order for Electrum Drum to change the
sample's BPM, it needs to know what it is first - the sample's
filename needs to have it's BPM in the name in the following format:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>&lt;samplename&gt;_&lt;bpm&gt;_&lt;rest of
name&gt;</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So basically if you just add a string &quot;_&lt;bpm
goes here&gt;_&quot; to a sample's filename, now the program will be
able to see what BPM the loop is and be able to stretch/shrink the
sample to fit the current BPM.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>So as an example you could take
&quot;MyLoop.wav&quot;, and it would then say &quot;MyLoop_126_.wav&quot;.
If there are more than one _XXX_ text in a filename, the first one is
used as the BPM.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">One you have loaded an audio sample you can
check the option in the Sound Slot dialog, to fit it to the current
BPM:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr88.jpg" NAME="graphics35" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=38 BORDER=0></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">This setting will remain in effect as long as
it's checked. If you change the project's BPM, it will re-adjust all
sounds that have the set to once again make them fit the current
project BPM.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="LAYERING"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Layering loops on
each other (How to use more than 8 sounds)&nbsp;</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">On of the big benefits of allowing sample
loading is you can overcome the 8 sound limit by doing a &ldquo;mixdown&rdquo;
of a drum pattern and then loading it up as a custom sample.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Note: It is not advisable to try to load a
very long exported song as a sample. It's better to just use shorter
loops. A song will take up a lot of memory and will probably not be
able to load and instead cause an error. Programs on the android
platform are only allowed to load up to 16MB of data (some devices
allow up to 24MB). A song could easily reach that in only 1 minute
length.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">For example, you could make a drum loop with
the 909 drumkit. Then you use &ldquo;Export&rdquo; to export the drum
loop into the /sdcard/electrum/exported folder as a WAV file.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You may now reset your drum machine and long
press a sound slot, and then choose the &ldquo;Load Sample..&rdquo;
button to load a custom sample into that drum slot.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">When the list of samples dialog appears,
click the drop down selection box to select &ldquo;Exported&rdquo;
&nbsp;and it will now instead list the exported loops that you have
created.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr11.jpg" NAME="graphics36" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=468 HEIGHT=283 BORDER=0>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">As a further example, if you set the custom
sample of the very first drum to a loop you have already made:&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Electr37.jpg" NAME="graphics37" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=481 HEIGHT=294 BORDER=0>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Then you can then simply set it to play on
the very first pattern button, and the loop will play and sound just
as it did before. The only limitation is that <B>you must have the
SAME BPM </B>as the loop you imported as a custom sample, so you can
match up with it.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">ince now one sound slot has a pre-mixed beat,
you now have freed up the other 5 slots for new sounds that you can
put over that beat.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can continue this process as much as you
want, creating a thicker and thicker beat. Simply keep exporting the
beat and then bringing it back in as a custom sample for the first
drum.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Just like music software on the PC, the

on two things:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">1. How many sounds you are trying to use at
once.<BR>2. The CPU power of your device.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">An older device may have trouble playing all

setting can be found in the Menu-&gt;BPM/Res/Patt Len menu item. If
you have audio glitches you can try to turn this ON and see if it
helps. This setting will raise priority on the Audio generating
thread to help prevent any glitches in the playback stream. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Some devices work better with the high
priority turned off! Try it both ways!</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The only way to ensure good performance is to

<P><A NAME="FAQ"></A><B><FONT FACE="Verdana">FAQ</FONT>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Q: What WAV file formats does Electrum
support?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>A: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can
load 22050Khz, mono, 8 or 16 bit files, OR you can now also load
&quot;normal&quot; wav's which are 44100Khz, Stereo or Mono, 16bit.
Electrum will internally convert the 44100Khz files into 22050Khz,
mono 16 bit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Q: When I load a sample all I hear is
static !??</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>A: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">Check
that the sample is not 24bit. While I coded electrum with the ability
to load 24bit files, android doesn't like them and all you get is
static (it seems to corrupt the file). Also on some custom ROMS I've
heard reports of static too - don't know why in that case but it may
be a similar problem.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Q: How can I get new drumkits?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>A: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">There
are 6 drumkits built into the program. If you want more sounds you
can now load custom samples into the drum machine. See the help
section about importing audio. Also check on the market for custom
sound kits that you can download and install.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Q: Why is my sound distorted at times?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>A: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">Sounds
can only be set to a certain maximum value when they are in a digital
format. If the sounds are turned up too loud, the software cuts the
signal off at maximum value. This will cause some artifacts which are
heard as distortion. Turn one or more of the sounds down (or turn
down the global volume) until the distortion goes away. I plan on
trying to add a soft knee limiter to the code eventually once I
figure out how to write it!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>Q: Why does the program sometimes seem to
&quot;stutter&quot; or &ldquo;gap&rdquo; if I try to change the
pattern on the fly or try to load many sounds?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>A: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">Electrum
is programmed about 90% in java code, which requires a good
processor. Android 2.2 is even more efficient and will perform very
well because of a JIT. On older phones, if the processor gets too
busy, it may not be able to keep the audio buffer full enough to keep
the music playing without breaking up.</FONT></P>
