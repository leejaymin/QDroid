	<h1>Objective</h1>
	<p>The game starts with a box, about half-full with marbles. Your objective is to remove sequences of marbles
	of the same color. Single marbles cannot be removed. A sequence consists of several marbles of the same color touching
	each other.</p>
	<p>Every time you remove a sequence, a few more marbles are dropped into the box - the amount depending on the 
	difficulty level. Additionally, every few seconds, a single marble will be dropped into the box. The interval between 
	these is dependent on the difficulty level.</p>
	
	<h1>Scoring</h1>
	<p>You get points for every sequence you remove. Longer sequences give exponentially more points, so plan ahead!</p>
	<p>Some surprise marbles (see below) may also affect your score.</p>
	
	<h1>Controls</h1>
	<p>Remove sequences by tapping on them.</p>
	<p>Tilt the phone left or right to slightly affect gravity.</p>
	<p>Shake the phone to shake the box - this may help some marbles fall into place. This will cost you an extra marble!</p>
	
	<h1>Surprises</h1>
	<p>Every time a marble is dropped, there is a chance for a surprise marble. You will recognize it when you see one!
	Surprise marbles have various effects - some are bonuses, some are penalties. You can get anything between extra 5 marbles 
	dropped and	an extra life!</p>
